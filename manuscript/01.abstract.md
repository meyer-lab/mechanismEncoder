## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Proteomic data provides measurements that are uniquely close to the mechanism of action for many cancer therapies. As such, it can provide an unmatched perspective into the mechanism of drug action and resistance. At the same time, extracting the source of patient-to-patient differences in proteomic measurements and understanding its relevance for drug sensitivity is extremely challenging. Correlative analyses are most common but are difficult to mechanistically interpret.
