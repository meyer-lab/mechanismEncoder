Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models are mechanistic models that are uniquely powerful for identifying the drivers of differences within measurements, integrating our prior knowledge, and interpreting data. However, a key question that limits their use for patient data is how to handle patient-to-patient differences. Constructing multiple patient-specific models is infeasible due to the limited data for each patient. Alternatively, universal models that use patient invariant and patient specific parameters to integrate data across multiple individuals have been proposed [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.10.013]. However, how to estimate these patient specific parameters is challenging as genetic and microenvironmental context influences signaling pathways in complex, non-linear and often poorly understood ways.


At its core, the challenge of integrating mechanistic models with patient-derived measurements is an issue of how to account for patient-to-patient variation. Mechanistic dynamical models have been widely applied to data of all types, but are used where the sources of variation among measurements can be explicitly identified and modeled. By contrast, variation among individuals can arise through both factors that can easily be identified, like changes in the abundance of the species being modeling, and endless other molecular and physiological factors that cannot be usefully enumerated in a mechanistic approach. Still, the structure of mechanistic models provides important constraints on the behavior of molecular pathways and interpretability that is missing from purely data-driven statistical methods.

Here, we propose the integration of autoencoders with mechanistic models to leverage both of their strengths. Specifically, this allows for training and predictions by a mechanistic model using patient-derived samples, with the autoencoder component accounting for patient-to-patient differences. We show that this allows for mechanistic interpretation of these data; more robust latent space representations of patient relationships; and integration of prior knowledge, other data sources such as *in vitro* experiments or other data types, and clinical measurements. Mechanistic autoencoders therefore offer a general solution to building mechanistic models from clinical samples.
