## Introduction

Proteomic data provides measurements that are uniquely close to the mechanism of action for many cancer therapies. As such, it can provide an unmatched perspective into the mechanism of drug action and resistance [@DOI:10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100004; @DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.007]. At the same time, extracting the source of patient-to-patient differences in proteomic measurements and understanding its relevance for drug sensitivity is extremely challenging. Correlative analyses are most common but are difficult to mechanistically interpret.

Mechanistic models are uniquely powerful for identifying the drivers of differences within measurements, integrating our prior knowledge, and interpreting data. However, a key question that limits their use for patient data is how to handle patient-to-patient differences. Constructing multiple patient-specific models is infeasible due to the limited data for each patient. Alternatively, universal models that use patient invariant and patient-specific parameters to integrate data across multiple individuals have been proposed [@DOI:10.1016/j.cels.2018.10.013]. However, how to estimate these patient-specific parameters is challenging as genetic and microenvironmental context influences signaling pathways in complex, non-linear, and often poorly understood ways.

At its core, the challenge of integrating mechanistic models with patient-derived measurements is an issue of how to account for patient-to-patient variation. Mechanistic dynamical models have been widely applied to data of all types but are used where the sources of variation among measurements can be explicitly identified and modeled. By contrast, variation among individuals can arise through both factors that can easily be identified, like changes in the abundance of the species being modeling, and endless other molecular and physiological factors that cannot be usefully enumerated in a mechanistic approach. Still, the structure of mechanistic models provides important constraints on the behavior of molecular pathways and interpretability that is missing from purely data-driven statistical methods.

To address this issue, we propose a model structure that is based on a variational autoencoder. Autoencoders are neural networks that embed data into low dimensional latent feature space by feeding the data through encoding and decoding layers [@DOI:10.1126/science.1127647]. The extracted latent features then provide a reduced representation of patient-patient similarity. We integrate mechanistic information by partly replacing the decoder layers in the network with a coarse-grained mechanistic model, where the encoded, latent representation of the data defines the patient-specific parameters of the universal ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. We apply this to AML patient samples, where proteomic and phosphoproteomic measurements with high tumor purity can be collected. This model structure enables mechanistic interpretation of these data; more robust latent space representations of patient relationships; and integration of prior knowledge, other data sources such as *in vitro* experiments or other data types, and clinical measurements. Mechanistic autoencoders, therefore, offer a general solution to building mechanistic models in the presence of unexplained sample variation, such as from clinical samples.
