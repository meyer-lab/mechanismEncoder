## Discussion

- Emphasize generality of approach
- Future possibilities
    - True validation in patient-derived samples
    - Pan-cancer modeling
    - Infer structure ala perturbation biology / neural ODEs?
- Cover other forms of mechanistic / data-driven integration?




FROM PROPOSAL

This project has the potential to enable routine use of mechanistic models to analyze clinical proteomics measurements. As such, one can easily envision applying a similar technique across many different cancer types as well as other diseases. It is hard to overstate the potential impact, as this can convert these measurements to (1) exacting predictions of which components to target in individual patients and (2) provide a mechanism-grounded view of patient-to-patient variation.
